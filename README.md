# Putting it All Together: IAM Lab

## Learning Goals

- Authenticate a user with a username and password.
- Authorize logged in users for specific actions.

***

## Key Vocab

- **Identity and Access Management (IAM)**: a subfield of software engineering
  that focuses on users, their attributes, their login information, and the
  resources that they are allowed to access.
- **Authentication**: proving one's identity to an application in order to
  access protected information; logging in.
- **Authorization**: allowing or disallowing access to resources based on a
  user's attributes.
- **Session**: the time between a user logging in and logging out of a web
  application.
- **Cookie**: data from a web application that is stored by the browser. The
  application can retrieve this data during subsequent sessions.

***

## Introduction

This is the biggest lab yet for this phase, so make sure to set aside some time
for this one. It's set up with a few different checkpoints so that you can build
out the features incrementally. By the end of this lab, you'll have built out
full authentication and authorization flow using sessions and cookies in Flask,
so getting this lab under your belt will give you some good code to reference
when you're building your next project with _auth_. Let's get started!

***

## Setup

As with other labs in this section, there is some starter code in place for a
Flask API backend and a React frontend. To get set up, run:

```console
$ pipenv install && pipenv shell
$ npm install --prefix client
$ cd server
```

You'll need to populate your models and create your own migrations.

You can work on this lab by running the tests with `pytest`. It will also be
helpful to see what's happening during the request/response cycle by running the
app in the browser. You can run the Flask server with:

```console
$ python app.py
```

Note that this will generate an error if you haven't created your models and run
your migrations yet.

And you can run React in another terminal from the project root directory with:

```console
$ npm start --prefix client
```

### Models

Create a `User` model with the following attributes:

- `id` that is an integer type and a primary key.
- `username` that is a `String` type.
- `_password_hash` that is a `String` type.
- `image_url` that is a `String` type.
- `bio` that is a `String` type.

Your `User` model should also:

- incorporate `bcrypt` to create a secure password. Attempts to access the
  `password_hash` should be met with an `AttributeError`.
- validate the user's username to ensure that it is **present** and **unique**
  (no two users can have the same username).
- **have many** recipes.

Next, create a `Recipe` model with the following attributes:

- a recipe **belongs to** a user.
- `id` that is an integer type and a primary key.
- `title` that is a `String` type.
- `instructions` that is a `String` type.
- `minutes_to_complete` that is an `Integer` type.

Add validations for the `Recipe` model:

- `title` must be present.
- `instructions` must be present and at least 50 characters long.

Run the migrations after creating your models.

Ensure that the tests for the models are passing before moving forward. To run
the tests for _only_ the model files, run:

```console
$ pytest testing/models_testing/
```

### Sign Up Feature

After creating the models, the next step is building out a sign up feature.

Handle sign up by implementing a `POST /signup` route. It should:

- Be handled in a `Signup` resource with a `post()` method.
- In the `post()` method, if the user is valid:
  - Save a new user to the database with their username, encrypted password,
    image URL, and bio.
  - Save the user's ID in the session object as `user_id`.
  - Return a JSON response with the user's ID, username, image URL, and bio; and
    an HTTP status code of 201 (Created).
- If the user is not valid:
  - Return a JSON response with the error message, and an HTTP status code of
    422 (Unprocessable Entity).

> **Note: Recall that we need to format our error messages in a way that makes
> it easy to display the information in our frontend. For this lab, because we
> are setting up multiple validations on our `User` and `Recipe` models, our
> error responses need to be formatted in a way that accommodates multiple
> errors.**

### Auto-Login Feature

Users can log into our app! ðŸŽ‰ But we want them to **stay** logged in when they
refresh the page, or navigate back to our site from somewhere else.

Handle auto-login by implementing a `GET /check_session` route. It should:

- Be handled in a `CheckSession` resource with a `get()` method.
- In the `get()` method, if the user is logged in (if their `user_id` is in the
  session object):
  - Return a JSON response with the user's ID, username, image URL, and bio; and
    an HTTP status code of 200 (Success).
- If the user is **not** logged in when they make the request:
  - Return a JSON response with an error message, and a status of 401
    (Unauthorized).

Make sure the signup and auto-login features work as intended before moving
forward. You can test the `CheckSession` requests with pytest:

```console
$ pytest testing/app_testing/app_test.py::TestCheckSession
```

You should also be able to test this in the React application by signing up via
the sign up form to check the `POST /signup` route; and refreshing the page
after logging in, and seeing that you are still logged in to test the `GET
/check_session` route.

### Login Feature

Now that users can create accounts via the API, let's give them a way to log
back into an existing account.

Handle login by implementing a `POST /login` route. It should:

- Be handled in a `Login` resource with a `post()` method.
- In the `post()` method, if the user's username and password are authenticated:
  - Save the user's ID in the session object.
  - Return a JSON response with the user's ID, username, image URL, and bio.
- If the user's username and password are not authenticated:
  - Return a JSON response with an error message, and a status of 401
    (Unauthorized).

Make sure this route works as intended by running `pytest
testing/app_testing/app_test.py::TestLogin` before moving forward. You should
also be able to test this in the React application by logging in via the login
form.

### Logout Feature

Users can log into our app! ðŸŽ‰ Now, let's give them a way to log out.

Handle logout by implementing a `DELETE /logout` route. It should:

- Be handled in a `Logout` resource with a `delete()` method.
- In the `delete()` method, if the user is logged in (if their `user_id` is in
  the session object):
  - Remove the user's ID from the session object.
  - Return an empty response with an HTTP status code of 204 (No Content).
- If the user is **not** logged in when they make the request:
  - Return a JSON response with an error message, and a status of 401
    (Unauthorized).

Make sure the login and logout features work as intended before moving forward.
You can test the `Logout` requests with RSpec:

```console
$ pytest testing/app_testing/app_test.py::TestLogout
```

You should also be able to test this in the React application by logging in to
check the `POST /login` route; and logging out with the logout button to test
the `DELETE /logout` route.

### Recipe List Feature

Users should only be able to view recipes on our site after logging in.

Handle recipe viewing by implementing a `GET /recipes` route. It should:

- Be handled in a `RecipeIndex` resource with a `get()` method
- In the `get()` method, if the user is logged in (if their `user_id` is in the
  session object):
  - Return a JSON response with an array of all recipes with their title,
    instructions, and minutes to complete data along with a nested user object;
    and an HTTP status code of 200 (Success).
- If the user is **not** logged in when they make the request:
  - Return a JSON response with an error message, and a status of 401
    (Unauthorized).

### Recipe Creation Feature

Now that users can log in, let's allow them to create new recipes!

Handle recipe creation by implementing a `POST /recipes` route. It should:

- Be handled in the `RecipeIndex` resource with a `post()` method.
- In the `post()` method, if the user is logged in (if their `user_id` is in the
  session object):
  - Save a new recipe to the database if it is valid. The recipe should **belong
    to** the logged in user, and should have title, instructions, and minutes to
    complete data provided from the request JSON.
  - Return a JSON response with the title, instructions, and minutes to complete
    data along with a nested user object; and an HTTP status code of 201
    (Created).
- If the user is **not** logged in when they make the request:
  - Return a JSON response with an error message, and a status of 401
    (Unauthorized).
- If the recipe is **not valid**:
  - Return a JSON response with the error messages, and an HTTP status code of
    422 (Unprocessable Entity).

After finishing the `RecipeIndex` resource, you're done! Make sure to check your
work. You should be able to run the full test suite now with `pytest`.

You should also be able to test this in the React application by creating a new
recipe with the recipe form, and viewing a list of recipes.
